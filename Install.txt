1. System Requirements

You must have access to a webserver that support php4 or greater and MySQL4 or greater. phpFFL is server independant. It can be run on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD or any other webserver that supports php and MySQL.

IMPORTANT:
The php configuration setting register_globals should be set to Off to run phpFFL for security reasons. 


2. What is included in this distribution.

New Installation: phpFFL MySQL database dump file located in phpffl_mysql folder. 
Upgrades: phpFFL MySQL upgrade files located in phpffl_mysql folder.

3. Importing the phpFFL database into MySQL

a) NEW INSTALLATION
I have included multiple dump files of the database for compatibility with multiple version of MySQL. 
phpffl_4_0.sql - MySQL 4.0 Compatible Dump
phpffl_5.sql - MySQL 5 Compatible Dump

To import this file you need to first create a blank database. Name it whatever you want. If you name it phpffl, to import the 4.0 Compatible version from the command line. The other version have the same syntax, just a different file name.
mysql -u USERNAME -p phpffl < phpffl_4_0.sql

You will then be prompted for your password. Enter you password and press Enter and the database will be imported. If you get errors importing the database it is probably due to your version of MySQL. Try again importing an earlier version of the Dump. Ex. If the 5 Compatible dump doesn't work try the 4.0 Compatible dump.

b) UPGRADE
Loook in this folder in the phpFFL download page for the upgrade files. 
phpffl_upgrade/version_number/

Each version of phpFFL includes an updates.php file that should be run. Just upload this to your phpffl root folder on your webserver and run it once through your browser. When finished it will say "Updates Completed". After this it is recommended you delete this file. 

If a database upgrade is necessary I will also include an sql file named phpffl_upgrade.sql.


4. Uploading the files to your webserver.

Upload all files in the phpffl_webfiles directory to your server root for phpffl. For example, if you want phpffl to be located at www.mysite.com/phpffl/, which points to htdocs/phpffl/ then upload the contents of phpffl_webfiles to this directory. 



5. Updating the config.php with your environments variables and user/pass information.

a) config.php
You will need to update the following variables in yourphpfflwebroot/program_files/config.php

$DATABASE_SERVER_PATH - The location of your database server. If your database server is located on your webserver you can leave this blank. Blank is equivalent to localhost. If your database server is not located on your webserver then it will probably be something like www.mywebserver.com, enter this. 

$DATABASE_USER - The MySQL database user you phpFFL can access your phpFFL database as. Make sure that this user has permissions access to the phpFFL database you create. If you are getting permission denied errors this is the first thing I would check. 

$DATABASE_PASS - The MySQL password for the above user.

$DATABASE_NAME - The name of your phpFFL database. 

b) install.php (NEW INSTALLATION ONLY)

If this is a new install of phpFFL. Once you complete step 5a (config.php) go to install.php in your browser. install.php is located in the root directory of phpffl. There you should update all of the Environment Variables before using phpFFL. 
NOTE: YOU MUST DELETE INSTALL.PHP BEFORE USING PHPFFL.

Below is a brief explanation of each Environment Variable.

 
$PHPFFL_WEB_ROOT - This will be the url to your installation of phpFFL

$PHPFFL_FILE_ROOT - This is the path to the folder on your server that the above url points to. If you are unsure of this go to yourphpfflwebroot/phpinfo.php and comment out die(); by changing 
die(); 
to 
//die();
Then load the phpinfo.php page. Ex: www.mysite.com/phpffl/phpinfo.php
The path to your phpffl file root on your server will be located at the bottom. Search for PATH_TRANSLATED. It will be this except remove phpinfo.php off the end.

$PHPFFL_SENDMAIL_FROM - The email address you would like automated phpFFL emails sent from. 

$PHPFFL_SEND_EMAILS - If you want phpFFL to send automated emails leave this equal to true. If you do not want phpFFL to send automated emails change this to false.

$PHPFFL_AUTORUN_PIN - Please change this to anything. It should be at least 6 characters and made up of letters, numbers and special characters. You will not need to remember this. You will only need to pass this to the automated update scripts. This is so that they can only be run by you so it is very IMPORTANT that you change this.



6. Setting up the automated Statistics and Players scripts. To automatically run these scripts you will need to setup cronjobs (Linux, FreeBSD) or Scheduler Tasks (Windows). 
NOTE: You can also run these scripts manually by logging in as a superuser and going to Admin -> Automated Scripts. 

There are 4 (A-D) automated update files included with this release of phpFFL. You can run any of these manually through the Admin section of phpFFL if you like or setup cron/Windows Scheduler to automatically run these for you. 

A) Automated Statistics Import 
program_files/autorun/myffl/statistics.php

To have this automatically import your stats you will need to setup a cronjob or a Scheduler Task if you are on Windows. You will also need to append the autorun pin to this file. Your statistics.php autorun should look something like this. You can also pass a Week variable to this script. The default is to import stats for the current week, but if you want to import stats for a past week add a variable called Week to the url (Ex: Autorun_Pin=1234&Week=2). Also, by default the statistics script only updates games that are in-progress. Please leave this behavior for your regular cronjobs, but if you need to update all games at the end of the week set Process_All to 1 (&Process_All=1) through the url or pass it as the 3rd arguement via command line.

Cron
php /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/statistics.php 6T334GA30H5!7B 

Windows Scheduler

C:/PHP/php.exe /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/statistics.php 6T334GA30H5!7B

IMPORTANT - When you setup this cronjob please limit it to run every 5-10 minutes. The feed it is importing from is only updated every 5 minutes so running this script more often than every 5 minutes will do you not good other than wasting your bandwidth. 

Also, If you want to set a job that updates all games that runs Tuesday mornings use something like this syntax. 
php /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/statistics.php AUTOPIN 0 1

AUTOPIN is your autorun pin. The next 0 is the week you want to process, 0 is for the current week. And the last 1 tells it to process all games. They must be in that order. 

B) Automated Players Update
program_files/autorun/myffl/players.php

To have this automatically update your players table you will need to setup a cronjob or a Scheduler Task if you are on Windows. This file also takes as a parameter "Days" which is the number of Days back you want to check for players updates. If you are running this once a week set Days=8 and you will be fine. You will also need to append the autorun pin to this as well. Autorun Pin MUST be the first variable, Days the second variable. It should look something like this.

Cron
php /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/players.php 6T334GA30H5!7B 8

Windows Scheduler

C:/PHP/php.exe /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/players.php 6T334GA30H5!7B 8

IMPORTANT - This file only needs to be run a few times a week. It only updates the players table with new players and updates teams of players who have been traded. I recommend setting this up to run once or twice a week. It should also be run just before your draft to ensure that you have the most recent players in your players table.


C) Team Stats Update (Total Points, Standings)

This file only needs to be run once a week, or you can run it manually if the stats change or you manually update stats for a certain game. You also need to add the Autorun Pin to this as well. It should look something like this.

Cron
php /home/path/program_files/autorun/general/team_stats.php 6T334GA30H5!7B 

Windows Scheduler

C:/PHP/php.exe /home/path/program_files/autorun/general/team_stats.php 6T334GA30H5!7B


D) NFL Schedules Update 

This will update game times & dates for when games are moved due to the new flex-schedule. By default it will udpate the schedule for the current week, but you can also pass an option parameter 'Week'. I would recommed setting up this job to run every Tuesday or Wednesday and it will update your schedule automatically. 

Cron
php /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/schedules.php 6T334GA30H5!7B

Windows Scheduler

C:/PHP/php.exe /home/path/program_files/autorun/myffl/schedules.php 6T334GA30H5!7B



7. Default Installation SuperUser Username / Password.

phpFFL default install includes one SuperUser. 
The default Username and Password for this user is:

Username: admin
Password: phpffl

PLEASE CHANGE THIS PASSWORD AS SOON AS YOU LOGIN.



8. Backing up your database.

The webfiles and config.php can be easily re-uploaded, but recovering your database is not so easy if it is corrupted or accidentally deleted. I recommend getting into a habit of backing up your database every week during the season. If you use phpMyAdmin you can easily do this through the web interface. If you use command line
mysqldump -u USERNAME -p phpffl_databasename > backupfilename.sql

You will then be prompted for your password, enter your password and press Enter and this will create your database backup. 



9. Starting a new season from a previous install. 

First off, when performing this upgrade please backup your current database first. This is very important for 2 reasons.


#1 - If an error occurs we don't want you to lose all the data you had in phpFFL!!


#2 - The scripts that archive your phpffl data are not yet completed so all of your data from the previous phpFFL season will be deleted so that you can run your league for the current season. If you backup your database there is a chance that we can eventually archive this for you. 

RESET SEASON - THIS IS REQUIRED TO RUN A LEAGUE FOR THE 2007 FANTASAY SEASON if you have data from last season or any dummy data in your phpFFL install. 
This will clear all the data from last season. As soon as you complete your install and upgrade your setting you should Reset all of your leagues so that they are ready for the upcoming season. To do this go to Admin -> Leagues and click on Reset Season. 

UPDATING PLAYER RANKINGS - Each team can manually update their player rankings (for autodraft purposes), or as an Admin you can also reset them for all teams in a league by going to Admin -> Draft and clicking on "Reset Player Rankings". This will wipe out all player ranking that teams have done and update them to this season's default rankings.
